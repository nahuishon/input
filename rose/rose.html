<h1> YOUR FLOWER IS ROSE </h1>

<img src="./rose.png">

<p>Rose people have a quiet and traditional exterior, but inside, they are passionate, romantic and deep.
     In touch with their own emotions, rose people can sometimes seem standoffish or prickly, 
     but their thorns are there to help shield them. Roses have delicate petals, and rose people have thin skin that bruises easily.</p>
